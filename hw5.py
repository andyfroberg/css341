# functions from SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, etc. (You can, however, use

# mean, standard deviation, covariance, etc. functions (if you choose to use 
# them) in the .py file.  (If you don't import scipy, etc., you'll be fine.)

    This function calculates and prints the correlation between two input lists

# Describe what the plot tells you. (You do not have to be "right" about what 
# the plot says, just not "wrong." That is, if you claim the plot says something 
# and it says the opposite of that, that's "wrong." If you say the plot says 
# something and it might say that or might not, that's okay.) I mainly want you 
# to try and interpret the plot.

# Given a lag of 0, all three stock indices have a lag autocorrelation 
# coefficient of 1.0. This is to be expected, because the correlation function 
# is comparing two identical timeseries, so they should be perfectly correlated. 
# As the lag increases, each respective autocorrelation becomes less correlated. 
# This also makes sense, because we would expect that closing prices far into 
# the future would have less of a relationship with closing prices today 
# (unless there were an unforseen event that suddenly made the stock market 
# closing prices remain flat for a long period of time, which is unlikely). In 
# just two weeks, the lag autocorrelation between each respective stock index 
# drops to around 0.5 or below, indicating that (given our current data set) the 
# closing prices of a given stock index today become a relatively poor indicator 
# of stock index prices just two weeks in the future.

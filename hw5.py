# 1
# Calculates and prints out the correlation between each combination of the 
# three indices, i.e., between nasdaq and sp500, nasdaq and djia, and sp500 and 
# djia. This calculation cannot make use of any pre-written calculation 
# functions from SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, etc. (You can, however, use 
# functions like shape, ravel, etc.) That is to say, you have to write your own 
# mean, standard deviation, covariance, etc. functions (if you choose to use 
# them) in the .py file.  (If you don't import scipy, etc., you'll be fine.)  
# Note that if you do this task by writing a correlation calculating function, 
# it will help you do #2 below.

    This function calculates and prints the correlation between two input lists
    (of stock indices). 
    
    Postitional Input Parameters:
        list1 | list (float):
            A list of stock index prices. Assumed to be floats.
        list2 | list (float):
            A list of stock index prices. Assumed to be floats.
        
    Returns:
        correlation | float:
            The correlation coefficient of two input stock indices.

# djia. This calculation cannot make use of any pre-written calculation 
# functions from SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, etc. (You can, however, use 
# functions like shape, ravel, etc.) That is to say, you have to write your own 
# mean, standard deviation, covariance, etc. functions (if you choose to use 
# them) in the .py file.  (If you don't import scipy, etc., you'll be fine.)

    This function calculates and prints the correlation between two input lists

    any other programming data structures):
